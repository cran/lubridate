Version 0.2.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* created parsing functions ymd_hm ymd_h dmy_hms dmy_hm dmy_h mdy_hms mdy_hm mdy_h ydm_hms ydm_hm ydm_h, which operate in the same way as ymd_hms().

BUG FIXES

* fixed bug in add_dates(). duration objects can now be successfully added to numeric objects.


Version 0.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* division between timespans: each timespan class (durations, periods, intervals) 
  can be divided by other timespans. For example, how many weeks are there between 
  Halloween and Christmas?: (christmas - halloween) / weeks(1)
  
* modulo operations between timespans

* duration objects now have their own class and display format separate from difftimes

* interval objects now use an improved data structure and have a cleaner display format

* lubridate now loads its own namespace

* math operations now automatically coerce interval objects to duration objects. Allows 
  intervals to be used "right out of the box" without error messages.
  
* created start() and end() functions for accessing and changing the boundary date-times of an interval


* rep() methods for periods, intervals, and durations



MINOR CHANGES

* added a package help page with functions listed by purpose

* eseconds(), eminutes(), etc. are aliased to dseconds(), dminutes(), etc. to make it easier 
  to remember they are duration objects.
  
* changed leap.years() to leap_years() to maintain consistent naming scheme



BUG FIXES

* rewrote as.period() to create only positive periods.

* fixed rollover bug in update.POSIXct()

* edited make_diff() to display in days when approporiate, not weeks
