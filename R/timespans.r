#' Timespan class
#'
#' Timespan is an S4 class with no slots. It is extended by the
#' \code{\link{Interval-class}}, \code{\link{Period-class}}, and \code{\link{Duration-class}}

#' Description of time span classes in lubridate.
#'
#' A time span can be measured in three ways: as a duration, an interval, or a
#' period.
#'
#' Durations record the exact number of seconds in a time span. They measure the
#' exact passage of time but do not always align with measurements
#' made in larger units of time such as hours, months and years.
#' This is because the exact length of larger time units can be affected
#' by conventions such as leap years
#' and Daylight Savings Time. Base R measures durations with the
#' difftime class. lubridate provides an additional class, the duration class,
#' to facilitate working with durations.
#'
#' durations display as the number of seconds that occur during a time span. If the number is large, a duration object will also display the length in a more convenient unit, but these measurements are only estimates
#' given for convenience. The underlying object is always recorded as a fixed
#' number of seconds. For display and creation purposes, units are converted to
#' seconds using their most common lengths in seconds. Minutes = 60 seconds,
#' hours = 3600 seconds, days = 86400 seconds. Units larger than
#' days are not used due to their variability.
#'
#' duration objects can be easily created with the helper functions
#' \code{\link{dweeks}}, \code{\link{ddays}}, \code{\link{dhours}}, \code{\link{dminutes}} and
#' \code{\link{dseconds}}. These objects can be added to and subtracted from date-
#' times to create a user interface similar to object oriented programming.
#' Duration objects can be added to Date, POSIXct, and POSIXlt objects to return a
#' new date-time.
#'
#' Periods record the change in the clock time between two date-times. They are
#' measured in common time related units: years, months, days, hours, minutes,
#' and seconds. Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer
#' values. With the exception of seconds, none of these units have a fixed
#' length. Leap years, leap seconds, and Daylight Savings Time can expand or
#' contract a unit of time depending on when it occurs.  For this reason, periods
#' do not have a fixed length until they are paired with a start date. Periods
#' can be used to track changes in clock time. Because periods
#' have a variable length, they must be paired with a start date
#' as an interval (\code{\link{as.interval}}) before they can be
#' accurately converted to and from durations.
#'
#' Period objects can be easily created with the helper functions
#' \code{\link{years}}, \code{\link{months}}, \code{\link{weeks}},
#' \code{\link{days}}, \code{\link{minutes}}, \code{\link{seconds}}. These objects
#' can be added to and subtracted to date-times to create a user interface
#' similar to object oriented programming. Period objects can be added to Date,
#' POSIXct, and POSIXlt objects to return a new date-time.
#'
#' Intervals are time spans bound by two real date-times.  Intervals can be
#' accurately converted to periods and durations. Since an interval is anchored
#' to a fixed moment of time, the exact length of all units of
#' time during the interval can be calculated. To
#' accurately convert between periods and durations, a period or duration should
#' first be converted to an interval with \code{\link{as.interval}}. An interval displays as the start
#' and end points of the time span it represents.
