# lubridate

Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on the type of date-time object being used. Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks, and R lacks these capabilities in some situations. Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not. Specifically, lubridate provides:

* a set of intuitive date-time related functions that work the same way for
  all common date-time classes (including those from `chron`, `timeDate`,
  `zoo`, `xts`, `its`, `tis`, `timeSeries`, `fts`, and `tseries`)

* quick and easy parsing of date-times: `ymd()`, `dmy()`, `mdy()`, ...

* simple functions to extract and modify components of a date-time, such as
  years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds: `year()`, `month()`,
  `day()`, ...

* helper functions for handling time zones: `with_tz()`, `force_tz()`

Lubridate also expands the type of mathematical operations that can be performed with date-time objects. It introduces three new time span classes borrowed from http://joda.org.

* durations, which measure the exact amount of time between two points

* periods, which accurately track clock times despite leap years, leap
  seconds, and day light savings time

* intervals, a protean summary of the time information between two points
