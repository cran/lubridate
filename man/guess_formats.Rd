\usage{
  guess_formats(x, orders,
    locale = Sys.getlocale("LC_TIME"), preproc_wday = TRUE,
    print_matches = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{input vector of date-times}

  \item{orders}{format orders to look for. See examples.}

  \item{locale}{locale to use, default to the current
  locale (also checks en_US)}

  \item{preproc_wday}{whether to preprocess week days
  names. Internal optimization used by ymd_hms family of
  functions. If true week days are substituted with %a or
  %A accordingly, so that there is no need to supply this
  format explicitly.}

  \item{print_matches}{for development purpose mainly. If
  TRUE prints a matrix of matched templates.}
}
\value{
  a vector of matched formats
}
\description{
  Guess formats from the supplied date-time character
  vector.
