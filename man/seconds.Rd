\title{Quickly create relative timespans.}
\usage{
  seconds(x = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{numeric value of the number of units to be
  contained in the period. With the exception of seconds(),
  x must be an integer.}
}
\value{
  a period object
}
\description{
  Quickly create period objects for easy date-time
  manipulation. The units of the period created depend on
  the name of the function called. For period objects,
  units do not have a fixed length until they are added to
  a specific date time, contrast this with
  \code{\link{durations}}. This makes periods useful for
  manipulations with clock times because units expand or
  contract in length to accomodate conventions such as leap
  years, leap seconds, and Daylight Savings Time.
}
\details{
  When paired with date-times, these functions allow
  date-times to be manipulated in a method similar to
  object oriented programming. Period objects can be added
  to Date, POSIXt, and Interval objects.

  y, m, w, d are predefined period objects such that y = 1
  year, m = 1 month, w = 1 week, d = 1 day.
